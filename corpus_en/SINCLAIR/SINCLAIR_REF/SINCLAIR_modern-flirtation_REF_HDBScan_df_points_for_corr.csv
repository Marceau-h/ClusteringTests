Mr.,-1,
grove of overhanging lilacs and laburnums,-1,
frightfully alarmed this morning,-1,
Providence,-1,
scrutinizing,-1,
"with an ill-supported smile on her
     quivering",-1,
reckless,-1,
"which she
     seemed vainly endeavoring to suppress",-1,
"though whether her
     agitation were not of",-1,
"and I often think how much
     interest and dignity is bestowed on every event of our short lives",-1,
and admiring everything with a lightness of heart that,-1,
leaning on Mr. Granville,-1,
"whether I am to be happy or
     miserable for life",-1,
send,-1,
so charming,-1,
with an accuracy worthy of a Mohican,-1,
Robertson',-1,
leaning on their gouty,-1,
rustic fairy-bridge,-1,
the watchman',-1,
rattled,-1,
though to her,-1,
with inextinguishable hope,-1,
"Captain De Crespigny misinformed my brother so much
     about the society here",-1,
Leeds,-1,
those who have resided,-1,
and with much selfishness,-1,
"whatever
     might be the impediments",-1,
would have thought,-1,
gives,-1,
sunk upon a seat,-1,
advised,-1,
beside which were written many,-1,
so unlike anything,-1,
without ever seeming,-1,
to palliate the faults,-1,
and the philosopher',-1,
over-head,-1,
evidently that,-1,
"which
     she thought might well",-1,
livid,-1,
over-excited,-1,
Florence,-1,
one could tell,-1,
"the nick-name of """,-1,
gave him an air of irritable melancholy,-1,
Tell John to drive,-1,
finding himself watched,-1,
Turning,-1,
yet,-1,
instead of attempting to give any rational assistance,-1,
"given at an expense which the young ladies
     know to be ruinous",-1,
Pinnock',-1,
Tunbridge-ware work-box,-1,
amidst the yells,-1,
gave way to bursts of tempestuous emotion,-1,
from hope to despair,-1,
"ours:—  
  
  ""We have lived and   laughed",-1,
we love each,-1,
penniless,-1,
preserving,-1,
hers,-1,
and medicine,-1,
woods,-1,
De Crespigny being her affianced,-1,
"though I know it is merely
     an unconquerable habit you have of saying the same thing to every young lady",-1,
her whole feelings lacerated,-1,
and a gouty black velvet shoe,-1,
Granville is not upon visiting,-1,
acre,-1,
milithary man,-1,
head,-1,
wealth and title,-1,
"whatever it
     be, is all his own fault,—and he was quite as ready",-1,
nerve where agony was born,-1,
without mutual confidence,-1,
"while
     her fancy very seldom strayed",-1,
from the butler,-1,
entitle,-1,
with a feeling of unutterable shame and consternation,-1,
"therefore it is quite fair that
     others should not pay at all",-1,
crucifixes,-1,
were in any danger,-1,
mysteriously disappeared—,-1,
gave an almost poetical,-1,
"I do not exactly see how poisoning would improve your
     own prospects",-1,
tell all and die,-1,
every Saturday night,-1,
such scrambling on,-1,
"and it will be the same thing
     now in De Crespigny'",-1,
"unless Richard were to tell
     me with his own lips that he had changed",-1,
had,-1,
begging for a seat,-1,
whose head seemed to have been nearly severed from her body,-1,
announcing that his long-pending law,-1,
though never born to blush unseen,-1,
concentrated nature which,-1,
ill-grown coppice,-1,
"dressed in their scarlet
     hunting",-1,
To-night!—this,-1,
"De Crespigny
     attended",-1,
"throws stones at my
     windows in the night, and frightens my very life out",-1,
"near which he and Caroline
     had been standing",-1,
"exactly imitating the very
     peculiar way in which Lord Doncaster",-1,
Ripon,-1,
pre-eminently handsome,-1,
pic-nics had never been invented,-1,
after a short,-1,
tone of deep-rooted anxiety,-1,
lip,-1,
a winding-sheet,-1,
her',-1,
But,-1,
seeing that it had been so recently obtained,-1,
Crespigny knows all this,-1,
which was bleeding profusely,-1,
which he called,-1,
every side,-1,
"If Mr. Granville were obliged to
     play sixteen hits at backgammon every forenoon instead of Lord Doncaster",-1,
pays so well!,-1,
"which
     became nevertheless distinctly",-1,
and hope itself grew dim within her breast,-1,
farm after farm,-1,
I am told,-1,
"known every
     vicissitude of existence together",-1,
"with as much care and science as an
     amateur in paintings",-1,
The accident is altogether very strange,-1,
6d,-1,
"than dispense with getting precisely what
     I like",-1,
from Dr. Johnson,-1,
admiring the polish of his boots,-1,
penny-wedding affair for that girl,-1,

well-rung-out laugh,-1,
flowed through that heart,-1,
Never!—urgent,-1,
"whatever it
     be",-1,

her own brother,-1,
"and sprinkled its glory on the highest
     tops of the trees",-1,
ruled and governed by the law and the Gospel of Christ,-1,
which even at this awful,-1,
"and often using
     her talents as a mimic",-1,
which I must try to forget,-1,
and a frightful hysterical laugh,-1,
"while
     her bright eye",-1,
and sent backwards and forwards with ceaseless diligence,-1,
their whole biography better than they know it themselves!,-1,
spell seemed over her,-1,
Demons,-1,
stuccoed gimcrack,-1,
"which became more and more
     intolerable as his eyesight was at length nearly extinct",-1,
which held together till so late an hour on Sunday mornings,-1,
voluntarily,-1,
"and avoid the most detestable of
     all",-1,
and saddening influence of,-1,
"and rung through the night
     air in tones of high delirium",-1,
"portionless girls, in which to buffet
     their way onwards",-1,
two-thirds of them,-1,
has been ill-used,-1,
age and blindness,-1,
considered,-1,
without so much,-1,
"I shall
     certainly be most happy to have it",-1,
Crespigny will no more,-1,
frivolity,-1,
seeing in this room sixty-five young ladies,-1,
"was much
     bruised and discolored",-1,
every fact recorded,-1,
the heiress,-1,
eyes,-1,
very long-lived and not very much,-1,
Lady,-1,
Indian,-1,
"said
     Mrs",-1,
beauty,-1,
from every,-1,
while her long eyelashes,-1,
very little higher than the cut for a railway,-1,
"and flirted in every
     style",-1,
"so
     utterly without life or",-1,
recognised her friend and companion,-1,
where the curtain never fell,-1,

and became redder than red,-1,
Crespigny is worth,-1,

not at all,-1,

"and whether it were the last
     snowstorm",-1,
"I admire,—Madam",-1,
lively,-1,
"fixed on himself

ran,-1,
did,-1,
and that dozens of young ladies would,-1,
bravado,-1,
"reminded her that there are simple pleasures she was born to
     enjoy",-1,
and raised an alarm,-1,
above his head with frantic gestures of rage and violence,-1,
be strangers to your eyes!,-1,
unpretending bottle of,-1,
at Loddige',-1,
"ashy
     hue stole over",-1,
than with a piece of Dresden china in,-1,
worn-out jests,-1,
lodgings,-1,
often do I ask myself why I,-1,
which attracted,-1,
grouped and painted according to her own taste,-1,
do I see you here?,-1,
every week,-1,
many with their hands clasped in amazement,-1,
and every look he looked,-1,
though the slightest indication of her doing so usually brought,-1,
Chinese,-1,
"were found mutilated and
     broken",-1,
Protestant,-1,
which looked like the ghost of,-1,
such as she had never even imagined,-1,
from Mrs,-1,
which was so very trifling,-1,
devoted to herself,-1,
and that is much at your,-1,
Turn'd at the touch of joy or woe,-1,
"not from
     indifference,—very far from that",-1,
"very

and the flaring trash people call flowers,-1,
journalizing,-1,
fox-hunting and grouse-shooting for,-1,
"whom he enslaved
     to his caprices",-1,
their beautiful path,-1,
"which I would rather never have been
     born than live",-1,
and hinting that this had rendered,-1,
at-home look,-1,
Neither Alnwick Castle nor Harewood,-1,
threatening,-1,
which is luckily not the case,-1,
Miss Granville,-1,
what do they lead to?,-1,
"arrows they levelled at each other became feathers before they
     reached their aim",-1,
teeth,-1,
cascades,-1,
"and carelessly staring
     at those who are vainly waiting",-1,
causing her a shudder of horror and alarm,-1,
and the sky above her head,-1,
gentlemen at Gascognes,-1,
after arduously scrutinizing every atom of evidence that could be gathered,-1,
I acknowledge it with sorrow and,-1,
by the eagerness with which Marion,-1,
if it were refunded,-1,
her night-cap,-1,
supercilious tone,-1,
covered her face,-1,
place over head,-1,
Kilmarnock Abbey,-1,
useless hoards which are lost to him at death,-1,
though the bright eye,-1,
the wealthy brother,-1,
Seabeach Cottage,-1,
your wit is as sharp to-day as that American scythe,-1,
"Once,—and",-1,
Forced,-1,
Captain De Crespigny this new pearl hoop,-1,
around her,-1,
"her bright eye to beam with additional
     lustre",-1,
and very remarkable things happen in it,-1,
endowed Sir Patrick with all those amiable qualities,-1,
Tuesday,-1,

Fevers,-1,

Unnameable,-1,

Constantinople,-1,

without its flippancy,-1,
therefore I am but one in a crowd,-1,
St. John's Lodge,-1,
"their happiness became gradually
     clouded with anxiety respecting the lovely but fragile",-1,
The Granville,-1,
Her whole thoughts are embittered by Captain,-1,
naturally,-1,
giving her a merry,-1,
every engagement that might endanger her meeting him,-1,
Every now and then,-1,
and a glow-like sunset was on her cheek,-1,
Harpe said,-1,
answer,-1,
pouring into her heart and spirit a ceaseless,-1,
feeling herself alone,-1,
till,-1,
shouting,-1,
Queen',-1,
fearful of agitating his sister,-1,
Captain De Crespigny already calls 'my   xml,-1,

"which ran along all the buildings as an
     architectural",-1,
cap and cockade!,-1,
will-o'-the-wisp as De Crespigny,-1,
every hope,-1,

was often beyond my intentions or,-1,
and a very disfiguring squint,-1,
Fountain's Abbey,-1,
"with so much grace
     and",-1,
I do!,-1,
"trusted, and believed that

"and well do I know the place you will give me
     there",-1,
spell-bound and,-1,
so that she felt certain,-1,
confidentially,-1,
from his earliest boyhood,-1,
generally,-1,
which will last only,-1,
which glanced through her mind,-1,
their pocket-money,-1,
when I really did sometimes pay my debts,-1,
and a great deal more,-1,
a roasting-jack and a mangle,-1,
with a light and careless laugh,-1,
which in her amounted to heroism,-1,
settled at home,-1,
which embellished,-1,
De Crespigny has nothing on earth,-1,
glasses,-1,
"the flattery of De Crespigny would do her no
     harm",-1,
and how he had said it,-1,
when you used to copy,-1,
"I not acknowledge the feelings
     of admiration that must be common to all in your presence",-1,
Wigton,-1,

Geranium,-1,

every opportunity should be given them to become,-1,
"therefore I am for floating along the tide with my arms
     folded",-1,
heart being much,-1,
Crespigny after her recovery,-1,
British,-1,
and a beaming smile of pleased emotion,-1,
the marble floor,-1,
which told every,-1,
"with an arch and
     pretty smile",-1,
De Crespigny was bowing himself,-1,
hollyhocks,-1,
Pic-nics had flourished at Studley,-1,
"that the grasp of an infant might
     have mastered",-1,
green trees,-1,
and soon after sauntered,-1,
so pious,-1,
mortgages,-1,
though the rapidity of her mind,-1,
though where in the wide world to direct,-1,
"which forced upon her
     the unwelcome and extraordinary conviction that all had been said in earnest",-1,
"though
     the drooping pinions of her ambition had been lowered",-1,
Coronets,-1,
